// What type is --> Easy way to refer the different properties + functions
  that a value has

==> Type Annotations and Type Inference(anumaan) <==

---> Type Annotations 
  --> Code we add to tell typescript what type of
      value a varible will refer to(We(developers) typescript the 
                              type by typing manually after variable name what type 
                              should be it)

---> Type Inference
  --> Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a
      varible refers to (TypeScript guesses the type:after assign 
                          value just hover on variable 
                          without define type annotations)

// ================================================== //

To get global things install types of their 
like ---> google maps npm install --save @types/google.maps or npm install @types/faker
